# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
 - The purpose of this analysis was to measure how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 - Looking at the fundraising data where the parent category was "theatre" we are able to see that the highest volume of campaings are launched in May.  We can also see that of those campaings launched in May almost 67% of those campaigns were successful, which is also the highes success rate of any month. While campaings launched in December where successful only about half of the time.  Based on the overall success rates launching your campaign between April - July would give you the best opprotunity to reach your fundraising goal.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
