# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
 - The purpose of this analysis was to measure how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 - Looking at the fundraising data where the parent category was "theatre" we are able to see that the highest volume of campaigns are launched in May. We can also see that of those campaigns launched in May almost 67% of those campaigns were successful, which is also the highest success rate of any month. While campaigns launched in December where successful only about half of the time. Based on the overall success rates launching your campaign between April - July would give you the best opportunity to reach your fundraising goal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 - After reviewing the data based on the goal amount it seems that campaigns were the goal amount is less than $5,000 are significantly more likely to reach their goal than campaigns where the dollar amount exceeds $5,000. The sample size of campaigns with goals of > $10,000 is rather small, but those campaigns that meet that criterion succeed at a rate of < 50 percent.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 - One of the biggest challenges I faced here was failing to save my workbook and losing the first copy of my analysis.  Causing me to have to redo most of the work.  Through this I will be sure to make an effort to save early and often.  Otherwise the ask was pretty straight forward and I was able to find the answers to most of my syntax questions online. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 1. Launching your campaigns in the spring would give you the best opportunity to reach your fundraising goals. 
 2. Campaigns are less likely to be successful as you get closer to the end of the year. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 1. Campaigns were the goal amount is < $5,000 are successful over 73% of the time
 2. The number of campaigns where the goal amount is > $10,000 is a fairly small number which makes it hard to draw any real conclusions from that data but they fail more often than they are successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
   - When looking at goal amounts, the number of campaigns drops significantly as the goal amount increases making it hard to trust the sample size and draw real conclusions.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
   - We looked at launch date, but we could also take the end date and create a campaign duration and analyze how successful campaigns are the longer they last.
